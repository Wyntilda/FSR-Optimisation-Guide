Disable modding DLC in Steam via Properties > DLC. It's twice the size of the base game and you don't need it unless you're planning on launching the Unreal editor yourself. Even if you're just applying a mod, all you need is the -NOSEEKFREELOADING launch option.
Add -nomovies to launch options in Steam.
Unlike TLC, Anniversary does not like being launched without Steam.

Need to do ini twix here.

The FXAA disabler is a mod that requires an additional file overriding other files and -NOSEEKFREELOADING, therefore shouldn't be used in speedruns. There may be other means of disabling FXAA.
