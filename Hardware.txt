The following is a *very rough draft* of good hardware that you can find in various used markets. I tend to focus on the best of an architecture or generation, or parts with unique quirks and features that make them worthwhile for specific purposes. I'll add more in-depth notes later.

**CPU**
i7-5775C (Broadwell) - Excellent 0.1% lows due to L4 cache
i7-3700K (Ivy Bridge) - Exceptionally low cache hit latency
i7-4960X (Ivy Bridge E)
i7-2600K (Sandy Bridge) - Reasonable price, overclocks like a champ if you're into that
E-cores will bring no benefit
Avoid chiplets
Ryzen is doing better as of Zen 3 but still has very poor RAM latency

**GPU**
GTX 285 (Tesla) - Supports Windows XP; not recommended for Anniversary
HD 7970 (GCN 1) - Supports Windows XP
R9 380X - Last high-end AMD card with analogue out
RX 590
GTX 980 Ti* (Maxwell) - Analogue out; can be forced to work on Windows XP
GTX 1080 Ti* (Pascal)
Any RDNA 1-2 card
6800 GS AGP (Curie) - For old builds / TLC only
7800 GS AGP (Curie) - For old builds / TLC only
7950 GT (Curie) - Performance won't be exceptional
Intel iGPU from 2015 onwards (TLC only)
AMD iGPU from 2022 onwards (TLC onlyish)

* = suffers from glow flicker bug

**Motherboard**
Z77 = Asus Z77 Sabertooth
Z97 = ASRock Z97(M) OC Formula
Z97 = Asus Maximus VII Impact
Avoid 4 DIMM boards for DDR4-DDR5 unless it's T topology (often designed for HEDT boards)

**Storage**
MX500 is cheap and good for SATA
SK Hynix P31

**PSU**
Corsair AX850
Corsair RM850x
Corsair HX1200
Corsair RM550
I promise I'm not shilling Corsair, these are just good; need more details here
HEADROOM IS GOOD. YOUR PSU IS AT ITS MOST EFFICIENT AT 1/3 LOAD. TRANSIENTS (short power spikes well above standard power consumption) HAPPEN.

**Mice**
MMO mice; useful for TLC and Anniv
Razer Naga Trinity
Logitech G600 - Higher click latency than Naga Trinity, less insufferable software; can be modded to be lighter weight than Naga Trinity

**Keyboard**
n-key rollover is very important, arguably the most important factor when choosing kb
AVOID 8KHZ KEYBOARDS (@CORSAIR) - you lose more than you gain
Wooting Two HE - analogue
