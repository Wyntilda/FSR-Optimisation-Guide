The following is a *very rough draft* of good hardware that you can find in various used markets. I tend to focus on the best of an architecture or generation, or parts with unique quirks and features that make them worthwhile for specific purposes. I'll add more in-depth notes later.

**CPU**
i7-5775C (Broadwell)
i7-3700K (Ivy Bridge)
i7-4960X (Ivy Bridge)
i7-2600K (Sandy Bridge)
E-cores will bring no benefit
Avoid chiplets
Ryzen is doing better as of Zen 3 but still has very poor RAM latency

**GPU**
GTX 285 (Tesla)
HD 7970 (GCN 1)
R9 380X
RX 590
GTX 980 Ti* (Maxwell)
GTX 1080 Ti* (Pascal)
Any RDNA 1-2 card
6800 GS AGP (Curie)
7800 GS AGP (Curie)
7950 GT (Curie)
Intel iGPU from 2015 onwards
AMD iGPU from 2022 onwards

* = suffers from glow flicker bug

**Motherboard**
Z77 = Asus Z77 Sabertooth
Z97 = ASRock Z97M OC Formula
Z97 = Asus Maximus VII Impact
Avoid 4 DIMM boards unless it's T topology (often designed for HEDT boards)

**Storage**
to do

**PSU**
Corsair AX850
Corsair RM850x
Corsair HX1200
Corsair RM550
I promise I'm not shilling Corsair, these are just good; need more details here

**Mice**
Razer Naga Trinity
Logitech G600 - Higher click latency than Naga Trinity, less insufferable software

**Keyboard**
n-key rollover is very important
AVOID 8KHZ KEYBOARDS (@CORSAIR) - you lose more than you gain
Wooting Two HE - analogue
