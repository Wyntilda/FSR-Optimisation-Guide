I'm doing testing on Arch Linux with KDE since that's what the cool kids use these days and should provide a familar environment for runners used to Windows.
I used archinstall and it seems fine. Very easy to use installer.
Make yourself able to use sudo. Add extra and multilib repos. linux-zen kernel is low-latency. I use XFS for filesystem, personally; ext4 is fine, too.

For the AUR, which provides useful packages for gaming stuff (such as mangohud, protontricks, etc.), I use yay.
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si

You probably want to use a virtual desktop for windowed gayming. (You can do this via Lutris or protontricks)
yay protontricks
Run protontricks. Select game. Ignore errors, you're fine. Select default wineprefix. Change settings. vd=1024x768
This seems to work flawlessly. Alt-tabbing is a little weird. Do note that this will lead to an extra frame of latency on KDE.

[Note for aspiring boffins: Wayland compositors such as KDE or gamescope are best used in fullscreen as they generally allow direct scanout. If anyone's coming from Windows 8+ or Windows Vista-7 with DWM enabled, that extra compositing delay is already there and there won't be a noticeable difference. Xorg window managers should in theory run pretty consistently in windowed compared to fullscreen, but MAKE SURE COMPOSITING IS OFF if using Xorg, as it is significantly worse than Wayland's compositing.]

The most relevant versions of Proton to test are 7.0 for hardware compatibility and current stable version (8.0 as of writing) for modernity.
Need to figure out best way to run OpenGL for hardware without Vulkan capabilities.

If running through Steam, game overlay must be disabled on a Steam-wide basis, not just a game basis, or the game will freeze.

TLC
========

Stability testing
Proton 8.0-2 - 
Proton 7.0-6 - 

Seeing if Proton loads videos and audio on par with Windows (this was an issue with older versions of Wine/Proton). Physique/HL bug is fine, but should be noted.
Media playback testing:
Proton 8.0-2 - PASS
Proton 7.0-6 - 

Need to test if damage and trading are on par with Windows (lots of stuff uses floats, but this is the most visible to us).
Float accuracy testing:
Proton 8.0-2 - 
Proton 7.0-6 -


DXVK 2.0+ / Proton 8.0+ requires Vulkan 1.3 capable drivers, hardware, and Wine version (you probably don't have to worry about the latter unless you know what you're doing).


Lutris notes: 
Game info: Runner is steam
Game options: DRM free mode on
System options: Gamescope > Enabled & Windowed (1024x768), CPU > Restrict number of cores used (1-2)
App ID is 204030 for TLC

Lutris with Wine runner seems weirdly difficult to configure and run properly, along with local (non-Steam) Proton. Until I figure out how to do this smoothly and accessibly, I think just launching through Steam is the way to go. The most reliable way to run TLC through Lutris is to run it through Steam, with DRM free mode off, which doesn't really do us much good.
